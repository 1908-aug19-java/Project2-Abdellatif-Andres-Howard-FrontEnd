Member: Abdellatif Elmansouri, Andes Felipe Cabezas, Howard Tran

Project Proposal : We are making an exciting new addition to Pokemon. A Web based application that will allow Pokemon trainers to CatchThemAll. Our Application will allow users to entire a simulated environment where they can catch multiple Pokemon and view their skills and abilities. Trainers will also be able to communicate with other Trainers and trade/battle their pokemon. We will be pulling all the information from PokeApi: https://pokeapi.co/
